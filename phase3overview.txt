CHATLOG PHASE 3:

In order to see the functionality of the chat you should use two tabs to create two users.
You can input your name and the name of a chat room. 
In order to see each others messages, both users must be in the same room. 
On joining a room, the room name will display at the top and welcome ____yourname_____ .
The System will then tell you what time you joined along with the message 'You have joined the room...'
As soon as someone else enters the room, you get notified by the System ex: "System 2:45 pm Amarjeet has joined!"

When chatting, your messages you've typed appear on the right-hand side, while any other users messages display on the left-hand side.
There is a change rooms option on the top left corner of the chatbox that will bring you back to the 'login' with name and room name options. 

Each message adds to the MongoDB with timestamp, name, text, and room. 

Technologies used: NodeJS, MongoDB, socket.io, express, vs code
